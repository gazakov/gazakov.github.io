# My Biography Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal biography website. This project is a showcase of my interests, skills, and contact information. It's designed to provide visitors with a glimpse into my world and an easy way to get in touch with me through social media.

## Features

- Responsive design, ensuring the website looks great on all devices.
- Use of ASCII art to add a unique and creative touch.
- Dark/light mode toggle for a preferred viewing experience.
- Interactive modals for an enlarged profile image view.

## ASCII Art

To add a personal and retro touch to the website, I've included ASCII art in several places:

- The moon/sun art serves as a theme toggle button.
- The wave art adds a whimsical backdrop.

ASCII art conveys my enthusiasm for classic computing aesthetics and creates a memorable visual identity for the website.

## Icons

The website features various skill icons that visually represent the programming languages and technologies I'm proficient in. These icons are sourced from [Skill Icons](https://skillicons.dev).

## Contact Links

Social media and contact details are provided for ease of connection. An interactive copy-to-clipboard feature for my Discord handle enhances user interaction.
